Simple model implementing 2 of the 3-step model of Jazayeri/Shadlen 2010 paper in the context of a modified RSG task. The intervals are taken from a bimodal distribution, and the selections (cost function) is either BLS or MAP, only MAP is implemented because mode is easier to find for my brain, improve much? It estimates the duration of a interval and selects a interval to produce, still needs to implement the production.

The code is sort of well commented, look at it and change the idiotic parts, you can even improve this by adding the third step.
